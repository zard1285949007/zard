If you see a beauty berry red as a wine,

I hope it reminds me of the days you spent with me

Whenever you decide then made up your mind,

We can drift with the wind and sail on waves, you and I

Like the shining sands of glass, we'll fade into the light

Together we shall find our secret land of love...

Oh Darling, tell me if this thing between us

Is something which they call everlasting love

If having everything's the meaning of love

There's nothing I wouldn't do or lose

I won't ever be afraid

Just to be with you again...
