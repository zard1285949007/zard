Are you really happy with
　This lonely game we play
　Looking for the right words to say
　Searching but not finding
　Understanding any way
　We're lost in this masquerade

★Both afraid to say we're just too far away
　From being close together from the start
　We tried to talk it over
　But the words got in the way
　We're lost inside this lonely game we play

☆Thoughts of leaving disappear
　Each time I see you eyes
　And no mater how hard I try
　To understand the reason
　Why we carry on this way
　And we're lost in this masquerade

★Repeat
☆Repeat

　And we're lost in this masquerade
