　Missisisippi
　In the middle of a dry spell
　Kenny Rogers
　Gonna lick you upside
　Mama is dancin'
　With baby on her shoulder
　The sun is settin'
　Like molasses in the sky

　The guy could sing
　Knew how to move everything
　Always wanting more
　He'd leave you longing for

☆Black velvet
　And that little boy smile
　Black velvet
　With that slow southern style
　A new religion
　That'll bring you to your knees
　Black velvet, if you please

　Up in Memphis
　The music is like a heat wave
　White lightin'
　Bound to drive you wild
　Mama's baby
　Is it the heart of every school girl
　"Love Me Tender"
　Leaves'em crying is the aisle
　The way he moved
　It was a sin, so sweet and true
　Always wanting more
　He'd leave you longing for

☆Repeat

　Every word of every song
　That he sang was for you
　In a flash he was gone
　It happened so soon
　What could you do

☆Repeat×2

　If you please (Repeat)
